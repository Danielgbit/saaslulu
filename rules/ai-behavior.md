# AI Behavior Rules

The AI MUST NEVER invent:
- Database fields
- API routes
- Environment variables
- External services

If required data is missing:
- Ask for clarification
- OR explicitly state assumptions before proceeding

The AI MUST:
- Prefer extending existing patterns over introducing new ones
- Treat AI features as assistive, never authoritative
- Prioritize security, validation and data consistency
