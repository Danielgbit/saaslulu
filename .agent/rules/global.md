# Global Rules – Antigravity SaaS

This is a production-grade SaaS built with Next.js (App Router) and TypeScript.

The AI MUST ALWAYS:
- Respect the existing project structure
- Prefer clarity over cleverness
- Avoid over-engineering
- Assume this is a scalable SaaS, not a demo

## Language Rules

### User Communication
- ALL communication with the user MUST be in Spanish.
- This includes explanations, reasoning, suggestions and chat responses.

### Codebase Language
- ALL code comments, documentation blocks and inline comments MUST be written in English.
- NEVER write Spanish inside code comments.
- NEVER mix Spanish and English inside code blocks.

### Priority
1. User-facing communication → Spanish
2. Codebase and comments → English
